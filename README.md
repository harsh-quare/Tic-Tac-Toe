## About the Project

This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other in the browser. The game has a minimalist design and provides a seamless, responsive experience.

## Features

- Interactive UI with real-time updates.
- Simple, intuitive game mechanics.
- Built-in logic to check for game win, draw, and reset.

    git clone https://github.com/harsh-quare/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

    cd Tic-Tac-Toe
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to play the game.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game is declared a draw.
5. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Future Enhancements
